# ODA_YOLOv3
The Object Detection project is built using YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 models trained on the COCO dataset with COCO weight values. The project aims to detect objects in real-time images and videos. The YOLO models are known for their high accuracy and speed, making them ideal for real-time applications.
